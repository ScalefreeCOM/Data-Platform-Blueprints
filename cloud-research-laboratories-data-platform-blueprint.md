# Cloud Research Laboratories Data Platform Blueprint

**Connect sample custody, instrument runs, methods, calibration, results, and publication or customer deliverables.**

Audience: sector operations, domain specialists, finance/commercial teams, security, governance, and data engineering. Updated: 5 November 2026.

## Technology roles in Research Laboratories analytics

### Discover and generate the model

[dlt](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) (data load tool) is the ingestion library for supported API, database, and file feeds. In this research laboratories design, it brings LIMS, sample accession, and instrument exports into controlled landing datasets with load evidence. [Flow.BI](https://flow.bi/) derives hubs, links, satellites, and their relationships from the data it profiles. The modeling input includes project, sample, and aliquot; actual data is required, while available source metadata improves the result. For the research laboratories model, [FCT](https://www.scalefree.com/consulting/turbovault/flowbi-connector/) (Flow.BI Connector for TurboVault4dbt) passes the generated logical model from Flow.BI into the TurboVault metadata workflow. [TurboVault](https://www.scalefree.com/consulting/turbovault/) generates model artifacts so the implementation follows the supplied metadata. Review those generated artifacts before executing the research laboratories transformations; Studio is the online access option, requested through Scalefree.

### Execute and extend the data product

[datavault4dbt](https://github.com/ScalefreeCOM/datavault4dbt) supplies the reusable staging, hub, link, and satellite macros invoked by the models. It contributes the technical history-loading foundation for project, sample, and aliquot. [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) runs the versioned SQL transformation project and its quality tests against the selected engine. User-defined Business Vault models add custody chains and calibration-effective intervals within that workflow.

### Choose the runtime and delivery support

[Databricks SQL and lakehouse tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/architecture) is the reference target for this research laboratories architecture. Databricks supplies the engineering and SQL compute; governed lakehouse tables hold source history, Vault entities, and derived products. This separates the query/runtime role from the underlying object storage. Deploy Databricks in the approved Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud environment near the source data and operational skills. That cloud supplies the surrounding storage, network, identity, and customer profiling runtime. Size and operate these services against the research laboratories pilot rather than a generic platform benchmark.

[Scalefree](https://www.scalefree.com/) supports the data-platform lifecycle through architecture, engineering, governance, and skills development. For this blueprint, that support can include the research laboratories source-to-model design, implementation of custody chains and calibration-effective intervals, and training the team to maintain the resulting product.

## Research Laboratories: operational workflow and source evidence

The first data product addresses this decision: **connect sample custody, instrument runs, methods, calibration, results, and publication or customer deliverables.** Start with one bounded business unit, contract/product family, site, or reporting period and name the owner of the resulting decision. The pilot draws from LIMS, sample accession, instrument exports, method/calibration records, ELN, and approved project/customer metadata.

| Workflow stage | Evidence and interpretation to retain |
| --- | --- |
| Accession | preserve sample identity and custody |
| Prepare and run | record aliquots, methods and instrument conditions |
| Review | retain original results, qualifications and authorized changes |
| Report | bind released outputs to a reproducible evidence package |

Preserve the planned or promised position as well as actual execution. Maintain source-event time, business-effective time, arrival/load time, correction references, and the cutoff used for reporting. A late or missing delivery remains a visible data-quality state; it should not silently become zero activity.

## Data Vault entities and fact grain for research laboratories

The business vocabulary includes **project, sample, aliquot, custody event, method version, instrument, calibration, run, result version, and released report**. The proposed fact grain is **sample/aliquot × method × instrument run × result version**. Keep identifiers namespaced by the issuing system and organization. Distinguish source facts from estimates, allocations, approved business rules, and publication snapshots.

Flow.BI profiles required actual data; mostly optional source metadata improves results. Its output passes directly through **FCT → TurboVault → generated-model review → datavault4dbt/dbt execution**. The generated Raw Vault preserves source-attributed history. Users add Business Vault entities for **custody chains, calibration-effective intervals, result qualification, and released-dataset manifests**. These user-authored extensions remain outside regenerated model paths.

Use the vocabulary to validate source semantics and define user-authored extensions. Review the generated implementation after TurboVault. Record the relevant package, adapter, generator, source-schema, rule, and runtime versions together.

## Worked research laboratories example: calculation and reporting scope

A run includes 100 samples plus ten control measurements. Ninety-five samples produce accepted results. Sample-result completeness is 95%; treating controls as samples changes the denominator. Repeated injections must retain attempt identity and review status.

Keep the calculation's numerator, denominator, unit/currency, eligible population, business calendar, cutoff, exclusions, and rule version with the published product. Original evidence and corrected knowledge should support both reconstruction of the earlier report and a separately identified restatement.

## Corrections, exceptions, and access in research laboratories

Exercise **sample relabeling, reruns, failed controls, revised methods, instrument time drift, and withdrawn results**. Build explicit associations for revisions and reversals so an event replay does not become a second business event. Measure reconciliation breaks at the fact grain before joining to descriptive or many-to-many relationships.

Protect **sponsor IP, participant-linked specimens where present, sensitive scientific work, and contractual data-use restrictions**. Establish purpose-specific permissions across direct SQL, BI, exports, and storage. Test revoked access and partner/client boundaries using the same routes consumers use. Retain source documents or large artifacts in an appropriate controlled repository and integrate authorized references and provenance.

[OECD Good Laboratory Practice resources](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/testing-of-chemicals/good-laboratory-practice-and-compliance-monitoring.html) provide a reference for relevant non-clinical health/environmental safety studies. Establish the actual laboratory discipline, accreditation, study classification, and sponsor requirements; GLP is not a universal classification for all research.

### Managed-cloud value and operating fit

Choose managed execution for measured delivery and operating benefits: faster product delivery, appropriate workload elasticity, reduced infrastructure administration, and useful integration. Retain the domain's confidentiality, safety, contractual, and records requirements. Platform features do not replace accountable business definitions or source reconciliation.

## Pilot ownership, acceptance, and rollout

Ownership is explicit: **laboratory leads own methods; quality owns review/release; project owners govern sponsor and publication permissions**. Engineers own connector behavior, pipeline state, generated-model releases and recovery. Governance owners approve processing purpose, field scope, external disclosure, and retention. The report/data-product owner decides how unresolved exceptions affect publication.

For acceptance, **trace a report to samples/runs/calibration, reproduce an amended result, and keep rejected attempts in evidence**. Also demonstrate restart after a partial load, reproducible historical output, negative access tests, clean-environment recovery, and regeneration without losing Business Vault entities. Document thresholds and tolerances before assessing results rather than selecting them after a discrepancy appears.

Train business analysts on the worked example and denominator/grain choices. Train modelers using the sector's difficult cases, and require at least two internal operators to explain ingestion, review, execution, corrections, and restore. Extend one source or domain at a time after the pilot evidence and operating cost are accepted.


## Cloud platform recommendation and economic case

**Recommended starting point: Databricks on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.** This recommendation assumes a capable engineering team and substantial file/event processing in the incumbent approved cloud. The workload rationale is **large instrument files and scientific engineering with governed result/metadata products**. Choose the specific cloud/region close to approved sources and operator skills; industry alone does not determine a universally best platform.

**Strong alternatives:** Snowflake for predominantly structured SQL/financial reporting; Fabric for Microsoft BI-led delivery; BigQuery for managed scan-oriented SQL without extensive custom engineering. Use the same source scope, historical correction cases, concurrency, freshness and recovery targets when comparing them.

| Platform candidate | Conditions to validate |
| --- | --- |
| [Microsoft Fabric on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/fabric/fundamentals/decision-guide-lakehouse-warehouse) | Alternative to evaluate. A candidate for SQL/Power BI delivery with a tested Warehouse target. Validate capacity contention, licenses, semantic-model behavior, and actual source connectivity. |
| [Snowflake on Azure](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-overall) | Alternative to evaluate. A candidate for Azure-centered SQL integration and independently attributed transformation/serving workloads. Co-locate sources where practical and cost external data movement. |
| [Snowflake on AWS](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/cost-understanding-overall) | Alternative to evaluate. A candidate for AWS-centered SQL integration and independently attributed transformation/serving workloads. Verify region, provider integrations, and contract pricing. |
| [Google Cloud with BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) | Alternative to evaluate. A candidate for managed SQL with on-demand or capacity-based economics. Test scan patterns, concurrency, project controls, and data-location alignment. |
| [Databricks on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/architecture) | Recommended family under the stated assumptions. A candidate for mixed event/file engineering, SQL, and model workflows. Choose the cloud near the data and skills; validate actual feature/compute availability. |

### Sector-specific cost and feature test

Measure **instrument files, repeat analysis, specialized compute, frozen datasets, and method validation**. Attribute normal refreshes, backfills, peak consumer demand, retries, retained history and staff effort separately. Report both cost per accepted source batch/data-product refresh and the meaningful business unit established in the worked example. A lower cost is useful only if correctness and the declared service target are maintained.

Use the difficult cases and acceptance exercise above as the platform benchmark. Compare cold and warm runs, record cache effects, and include the cost of a historical reconstruction. New streaming, AI, sharing, or semantic features enter the design only through a named use case, a supported regional/edition configuration, a measured benefit, and an incremental operating cost.

## Operate and govern by data product

Assign each product a business owner, technical operator, purpose, grain, definitions, refresh target, classification, retention, and quality thresholds. Preserve source batch/offset IDs, code/package versions, calculation rules, cutoff, and exception status with published outputs. Keep operational-system decisions and regulated calculation engines within their validated authority boundaries.

Use institutional identity, scoped service principals, separate development/production, secret management, auditable privileged access, and approved network routes. Enforce restrictions through SQL, BI, export, and underlying storage. Test actual negative access and revocation behavior. A managed service or compliant provider does not establish application-level compliance.

Choose orchestration and alerts around the product's dependencies. A late source or unresolved material reconciliation break should affect publication status. Define retries and recovery of ingestion state, metadata/catalogs, data, credentials, and deployment artifacts. Demonstrate rollback and a clean-environment restore.

## Compare lifecycle cost and delivery value

The managed-cloud case is **shorter delivery time, reduced infrastructure administration, elastic execution, and useful platform integration**. The decision is an operating-model tradeoff. Keep privacy, contractual requirements, data-location constraints, and an exit plan even when sovereignty is not the main objective.

Use a three-year model with an explicit growth scenario:

`TCO = migration and implementation + platform/compute + storage and retained copies + ingestion/orchestration + network/egress + BI/security licenses + support + operating staff + recovery/testing + exit allowance`

Account for negotiated rates and existing commitments as incremental costs, without treating sunk licenses or staff effort as free. Measure normal, peak, backfill, and quiet-period workloads. Record costs per completed data-product refresh and per meaningful business unit, together with correctness and service quality. Compare low/base/high demand and sensitivity to refresh frequency, retention, concurrency, and source growth. Do not publish a cost-saving percentage without the corresponding workload and pricing assumptions.

For feature decisions, record the use case, production availability in the selected region/edition, integration limits, expected outcome, incremental cost, operating owner, and rollback. Prefer an ordinary SQL or scheduled pipeline when it meets the product goal more economically. New AI, streaming, or sharing capabilities should earn their place through a measured pilot.

## Delivery gates

1. Agree the product's grain, calculation, scope, cutoff, access, and reconciliation targets with its business owner.
2. Benchmark the recommended platform against the strongest alternative using the same sources and workload, including cold/warm runs and concurrent consumers.
3. Build the ingestion/model-generation path; review after TurboVault; run tested macros and add Business Vault rules.
4. Prove the industry's worked example and failure cases, historical reconstruction, permissions, restart, restore, and regeneration behavior.
5. Compare measured run cost and staff effort with the business case. Document limitations and choose the platform before committing to broad migration.
