# Cloud Hospitals Databricks Data Platform Blueprint

**Connect hospital activity, capacity, clinical events, and finance to explain patient flow and operational performance.**


This hospitals data platform blueprint implements Data Vault on Databricks using dlt, Flow.BI, dbt and Dawiso. Follow the source workflow for staffed-bed utilization and patient flow, then validate history, business rules, deployment and cost against the worked example.
Audience: hospital leadership, nursing operations, clinical informatics, theatre management, revenue cycle, privacy, and data teams. Updated: 5 November 2026.

## From encounter, ward stay, and bed to a Databricks data product

1. [dlt](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) is the open-source ingestion library used to extract approved admission/transfer/discharge, bed-management, and capacity data. The hospitals team owns connector code, load state, schedules, and a tested landing-to-target path.

2. [Flow.BI](https://flow.bi/) supplies the data-driven modeling stage that precedes physical model generation for encounter, ward stay, and bed. Actual data is required; mostly optional source metadata improves modeling. Its customer-cloud Docker component profiles locally and sends derived metadata and statistical fingerprints to the backend.

3. [FCT](https://www.scalefree.com/consulting/turbovault/flowbi-connector/) (Flow.BI Connector for TurboVault4dbt) handles the connector handoff from Flow.BI to the downstream model generator. [TurboVault](https://www.scalefree.com/consulting/turbovault/) generates the dbt models from that metadata. Its generated models are reviewed before execution; request online TurboVault Studio access through Scalefree.

4. [datavault4dbt](https://github.com/ScalefreeCOM/datavault4dbt) is the dbt macro package that implements standard Data Vault loading patterns, while [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) provides the build-and-test workflow that executes the model dependencies on the database. Additional user-authored Business Vault entities implement **ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators** outside the regenerated paths.

5. [Databricks SQL and lakehouse tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/architecture) is the database/compute target for hospitals: Databricks supplies the engineering and SQL compute; governed lakehouse tables hold source history, Vault entities, and derived products. This separates the query/runtime role from the underlying object storage. Deploy Databricks in the approved Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud environment near the source data and operational skills. That cloud supplies the surrounding storage, network, identity, and customer profiling runtime.

6. [Dawiso](https://www.dawiso.com/product/data-catalog) is the commercial catalog for encounter, ward stay, and bed, connecting business definitions, owners, discovered assets, and lineage evidence. Its deployment and metadata processing need a separate operating agreement.

7. [Scalefree](https://www.scalefree.com/) provides data and AI consulting, Data Vault implementation, software integration, and training. The engagement connects Databricks implementation to the hospitals workflow, governed business rules, and team enablement.

Source values for encounter, ward stay, and bed are required for profiling. The local Docker component keeps raw source records in the customer environment during profiling and needs approved outbound backend connectivity for derived metadata and fingerprints. Flow.BI output goes directly through FCT and TurboVault; the review occurs after generation and before macro execution. Catalog edges represent configured integrations with tested coverage, including explicit lineage where automatic discovery is incomplete.

## Follow a patient through the hospital

Hospital operations involve admission, transfers, procedures, diagnostics, and discharge, often recorded in different systems. The platform must preserve event order and corrections while reconciling patient encounters with physical capacity. It supports planning and retrospective analysis; bedside systems, device control, prescribing, and emergency decisions remain within validated clinical workflows.

Start with staffed-bed utilization and inpatient flow for one hospital and selected wards. Include admission/discharge/transfer events, bed-management history, staffing-capacity declarations, and encounter master data. The broader healthcare blueprint addresses cross-provider identity and referrals; this blueprint concentrates on in-hospital operations.

| Operational step | Primary evidence | Question answered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admission | Encounter registration and actual arrival | When did the patient enter the measured inpatient scope? |
| Bed assignment and transfer | Assignment intervals, ward changes, correction events | Which ward and bed were occupied, and when? |
| Procedure or diagnostic work | Theatre case, laboratory, radiology, encounter links | Which service events contributed to flow? |
| Discharge readiness and departure | Readiness status, discharge order, actual departure | Separate clinically ready, administratively discharged, and physically departed states. |
| Billing and close | Coding, charge capture, payer and ledger controls | Reconcile activity to billable and recorded financial events. |


## Build encounter and location history before dashboards

Use a governed patient-identity crosswalk and preserve merge/unmerge events. Distinguish patient, encounter, episode, ward, physical bed, staffed capacity interval, procedure, order, specimen, and claim/invoice. A transferred patient can create multiple ward stays inside one encounter.

Raw Vault entities preserve original admission/transfer/discharge events and amendments. Add Business Vault entities for ward-stay intervals, encounter episodes, staffed-capacity intervals, operational calendars, and exclusions. Flow.BI output reaches FCT and TurboVault directly; review generated models after TurboVault and before macro execution.

Use existing clinical interface infrastructure and documented [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) resources where supported. Pin interface versions and validate resource history, repeated fields, and reference resolution. Do not treat a database extract as a substitute for agreed clinical event semantics.


## Worked example: staffed capacity and occupancy

A ward declares 20 staffed beds for a 24-hour day: 480 staffed bed-hours. If validated occupancy intervals total 360 hours, an illustrative occupancy measure is 75%. Physical installed capacity may be larger; it is a different denominator.

Define how leave, temporary closure, boarding, observation, and overlapping assignments affect the metric. If a bed is closed for part of a day, use its effective capacity interval. Compute durations from instants consistently and explain local-day aggregation across daylight-saving changes.

The analytical grain is **encounter × ward-stay interval**, joined to **ward × staffed-capacity interval** through controlled interval logic. Retain interval-building rule versions and report cutoff. Test both overlap and gaps rather than filling them silently.


## Keep clinical, workforce, and financial permissions distinct

Patient-level flow data requires authorized operational access. Clinical content, staff rosters, sensitive specialties, and billing identifiers need their own field and purpose restrictions. Treat demographic matching, hospital discharge status, and clinical death records with explicit source precedence and escalation.

Map relevant [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng) and local health-record requirements. For US entities in scope, evaluate [HIPAA roles and business-associate arrangements](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html). Pseudonymized analytics still needs governance. Protect small specialty/diagnosis aggregates in exports.

Run Flow.BI's local Docker component within the hospital-controlled Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud environment. Approve the outbound fingerprint/metadata payload and source access without introducing workload or availability problems for clinical systems.


## Pilot with nursing operations and clinical informatics

Nursing operations approves capacity semantics, informatics validates clinical events, ward managers resolve assignment exceptions, and finance defines activity-to-revenue boundaries. Training should include an admission correction, a ward transfer, a staffed-bed closure, and a patient unmerge.

Release criteria include reconciliation of encounters to the source system, sampled agreement of reconstructed stays with bed-management evidence, verified denominator changes, source-to-metric lineage, and explicit handling of late discharge events. A patient transfer must neither double-count bed occupancy nor lose the encounter.

Extend later to theatre utilization, diagnostic turnaround, discharge delays, and revenue-cycle products. Define separate denominators and clinical ownership for each. Complete technology, deployment, training, and reference guidance follows.


## Databricks deployment and physical design

This is the **Databricks implementation** of the hospitals workflow. Its purpose is **staffed-bed utilization and patient flow**. Validate the selected target against the worked example and operational failure cases in this document. The platform comparison is available separately; this article carries the complete implementation, training, resources, and Next steps for this stack.

[Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/architecture) contributes engineering and SQL execution over governed lakehouse tables. Use the approved incumbent cloud for storage, network and identity, then retain raw deliveries, typed source tables, the Raw Vault, and ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators with an owned writer/refresh contract. Unity Catalog governs the platform assets; Dawiso provides the cross-stack business discovery and lineage layer in this cloud edition.

Evaluate ingestion/replay and SQL serving for hospitals together. Preserve the fact grain and corrections while comparing job/SQL/serverless choices supported by the chosen cloud and edition. Include platform usage, underlying infrastructure where separately billed, table maintenance, storage, network, retries, and retained environments. A streaming or AI feature needs a measurable product use case.

### Table ownership and event replay

Keep a durable source-delivery record, typed staging tables, generated Vault tables and user-authored Business Vault models. Register the production tables under the agreed Unity Catalog catalog/schema with one accountable writer per table. For encounter, ward stay, and bed, preserve source event/version identifiers, business-effective time and load time; a streaming checkpoint is processing state, not the historical business record. A replay needs an idempotence contract and explicit handling of corrections and deleted source records.

### SQL/dbt execution and physical layout

Use dbt-databricks against the selected SQL execution endpoint and pin its compatibility with datavault4dbt. Validate the materializations and history-load behavior on Delta tables before scaling. Partitioning, clustering and maintenance choices follow the hospitals access and update pattern; use query profiles and maintenance cost to choose them. Prevent notebooks or engineering jobs from writing concurrently to dbt-owned Vault targets. Bronze/silver/gold naming may describe processing stages, but each table still needs an explicit mapping to landing, Raw Vault, Business Vault or serving.

### Separate engineering demand from serving commitments

Allocate source preparation, history replay, dbt transformation and analytical serving to owned workloads. Benchmark a late-source correction while consumers query ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators; track both result correctness and contention. The budget includes platform usage and cloud compute/storage/network charges where applicable, idle or restart overhead, table maintenance and retained data. Unity Catalog supplies native asset governance; Dawiso connects cross-stack business meaning and lineage without replacing platform authorization.

### Ingestion contract

**Primary ingestion: dlt (open-source library).** The hospitals team owns source connectors, extraction/load state, schedules, runtime and recovery. Preserve source identifiers, deleted-record evidence and schema changes in a controlled load contract. Use a supported destination or a validated intermediate file/database load path; source support does not establish target-write support. Include engineering effort, execution infrastructure and maintenance in the lifecycle cost.

### Platform acceptance and operating evidence

The release record contains job and SQL execution evidence, Delta table versions, dbt artifacts, and compute attribution. Join it to source delivery IDs, generator/package/adapter versions, model approval, calculation rule versions and publication cutoffs. Execute a duplicate, a late correction, partial-load recovery, regeneration without losing user-authored Business Vault entities, permission revocation and clean-environment restore using this industry's actual grain.

Run morning operational dashboards while reconstructing bed intervals after a late discharge and a staffed-capacity correction. Use identical source scope, correction cases, service targets, and business definitions when comparing platforms.

Report cost per **validated ward-day product and operational reporting refresh**, plus end-to-end freshness, concurrent-consumer response, reconciliation exceptions, and operator hours. Specifically measure refresh frequency, morning dashboard concurrency, repeated interval joins, and semantic-model duplication.

### Implementation documentation

Use the [Databricks platform documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/architecture), [dbt-databricks setup](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/local/connect-data-platform/databricks-setup), and [datavault4dbt supported platforms and documentation](https://www.datavault4dbt.com/) to pin the implementation. Feature availability and adapter/materialization behavior are part of the pilot acceptance record. Select each additional feature against a concrete hospitals use case and incremental operating cost.


## Operate and govern by data product

Assign each product a business owner, technical operator, purpose, grain, definitions, refresh target, classification, retention, and quality thresholds. Preserve source batch/offset IDs, code/package versions, calculation rules, cutoff, and exception status with published outputs. Keep operational-system decisions and regulated calculation engines within their validated authority boundaries.

Use institutional identity, scoped service principals, separate development/production, secret management, auditable privileged access, and approved network routes. Enforce restrictions through SQL, BI, export, and underlying storage. Test actual negative access and revocation behavior. A managed service or compliant provider does not establish application-level compliance.

Choose orchestration and alerts around the product's dependencies. A late source or unresolved material reconciliation break should affect publication status. Define retries and recovery of ingestion state, metadata/catalogs, data, credentials, and deployment artifacts. Demonstrate rollback and a clean-environment restore.


## Compare lifecycle cost and delivery value

The managed-cloud case is **shorter delivery time, reduced infrastructure administration, elastic execution, and useful platform integration**. The decision is an operating-model tradeoff. Keep privacy, contractual requirements, data-location constraints, and an exit plan even when sovereignty is not the main objective.

Use a three-year model with an explicit growth scenario:

`TCO = migration and implementation + platform/compute + storage and retained copies + ingestion/orchestration + network/egress + BI/security licenses + support + operating staff + recovery/testing + exit allowance`

Account for negotiated rates and existing commitments as incremental costs, without treating sunk licenses or staff effort as free. Measure normal, peak, backfill, and quiet-period workloads. Record costs per completed data-product refresh and per meaningful business unit, together with correctness and service quality. Compare low/base/high demand and sensitivity to refresh frequency, retention, concurrency, and source growth. Do not publish a cost-saving percentage without the corresponding workload and pricing assumptions.

For feature decisions, record the use case, production availability in the selected region/edition, integration limits, expected outcome, incremental cost, operating owner, and rollback. Prefer an ordinary SQL or scheduled pipeline when it meets the product goal more economically. New AI, streaming, or sharing capabilities should earn their place through a measured pilot.


## Delivery gates

1. Agree the product's grain, calculation, scope, cutoff, access, and reconciliation targets with its business owner.
2. Benchmark the recommended platform against the strongest alternative using the same sources and workload, including cold/warm runs and concurrent consumers.
3. Build the ingestion/model-generation path; review after TurboVault; run tested macros and add Business Vault rules.
4. Prove the industry's worked example and failure cases, historical reconstruction, permissions, restart, restore, and regeneration behavior.
5. Compare measured run cost and staff effort with the business case. Document limitations and choose the platform before committing to broad migration.


## Catalog ownership and lineage with Dawiso

[Dawiso](https://www.dawiso.com/product/data-catalog) adds the business glossary, asset discovery, ownership, and lineage context for hospitals. It connects the meaning of encounter and the rules for ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators to the implemented datasets.

Use [Dawiso's deployment and integration options](https://www.dawiso.com/product/enterprise-deployment-built-for-flexibility-and-security) to select the supported catalog location and network path. Record the edition, contributor/viewer licensing, metadata scanning scope, and operating owner. Validate discovery of Databricks assets and dbt lineage using the supported connectors or an explicit metadata mapping.

| Catalog responsibility | Implementation in this blueprint |
| --- | --- |
| Business meaning | For this product, register **encounter, ward stay, bed, capacity interval, and procedure** as governed concepts linked to real assets. Describe **ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators** with an owner, calculation/rule version, eligible population, cutoff, and known limitations. Publish only the metadata fields that the catalog users are authorized to see. |
| Metadata ingestion | Discover the selected database/BI assets using the [supported connectors](https://www.dawiso.com/connectors) and validate dbt/generated-model metadata exchange for the chosen version. Define a controlled import/API mapping for gaps; do not assume a direct Flow.BI or FCT catalog connector. Keep the modeling service's generated metadata distinct from the catalog's approved business glossary. |
| Quality and lineage evidence | dbt executes transformation tests; Dawiso records the associated definitions, owners, evidence links, and quality context. Select and validate the integration that publishes results; the catalog does not replace the test engine. |
| Release evidence | Catalog acceptance follows the hospitals pilot: trace an approved source field through a generated model and Business Vault extension to a published metric, then test a schema change, a stale scan, and a permission revocation. Mask sample values and sensitive SQL/descriptions where required. Track scan coverage and unresolved lineage gaps explicitly. |

## Questions about hospitals analytics on Databricks

### How should Databricks preserve hospitals history?

Keep a durable source record and one accountable writer for each governed Delta target. Model encounter, ward stay, and bed in the Vault before deriving ward-stay intervals and staffed-capacity denominators; test replay, correction handling and SQL serving together. Unity Catalog authorization and Dawiso business lineage have separate roles.

### What should the hospitals Databricks pilot prove?

Use the worked example and difficult cases to validate **staffed-bed utilization and patient flow**. Retain source-to-output reconciliation, duplicate and late-record results, access-denial evidence, restore behavior and the measured cost per accepted product. Confirm that regeneration preserves user-authored Business Vault rules and that Dawiso lineage covers the actual route.
